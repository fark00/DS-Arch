# Pattern Recognition

In this program, by receiving a pattern of numbers, we check whether the input matrix contains this pattern or not.

## Input
At first, the program receives two numbers that represent the number of rows and columns of the matrix, and then it receives the matrix, then the length of the template is received, and finally the template is taken from the user. To make this clearer, we see an example below.

**Note** that the number of rows and columns in the matrix is less than 500.

## Steps:
g++ pro.cpp -o pro
./pro

# Example:

## Output
The start and end coordinates of the match are printed in the output.
