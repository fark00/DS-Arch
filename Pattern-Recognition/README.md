# Pattern Recognition

## In this program, by receiving a matrix and a pattern, we check whether this pattern is in the matrix or not.

First, two numbers are taken from the user, which is the number of rows and columns, and then the matrix is received. After this, a number is taken as the length of the pattern and finally the pattern is received.

After running the program, the start and end coordinates of the match are displayed in the output.

### Notes:
* It is guaranteed that the pattern must be present in the matrix.
* The pattern can be vertical or horizontal in the matrix.
* The numbers are between 0 and 255.
* The number of rows and columns is less than 500.
