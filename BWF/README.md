# BWF

## In this program, memory is implemented and managed by a doubly linked list, and three strategies, bestfit, firstfit and worstfit, are implemented to allocate memory. We also use the free command with the memory name to free memory.

## The input information is read from the txt.in file and the program output is written to the out.txt file.
